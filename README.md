# RomanNumeralConverter

I spent a bit over 3 hours working on this. I unfortunately was not able to get the entire code working the way I wanted to. It can convert Roman Numerals
into integers but fails to check the Roman Numeral for validity. I wrote out the what I thought would work but was having trouble with the logical or operator.
